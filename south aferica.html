<h1 style="color:blue">SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG</h1>
<img src="sa flag.webp" height="300" width="500">
<p style="color:blue">South frican national flag consisting of a horizontally oriented Y-shape (known in heraldry as a pall) in green, with yellow (gold) and white borders, separating sections of red and blue and a black hoist triangle.
<br> The flag’s width-to-length ratio is 2 to 3.

The two major European populations in South Africa, the Dutch (now Afrikaners) and the English,
 brought flags whose use persisted until 1994. The orange-white-blue tricolour of the 17th-century Netherlands was the basis 
 for the national flag officially hoisted on May 31, 1928, by the Union of South Africa. The British Union Jack and the flags of the Transvaal
  and Orange Free State were added to the centre of that flag. Absent was any symbol for the overwhelming majority of the population, 
  black Africans, or for the country’s Coloured (mixed-race) and Indian inhabitants.</p>
