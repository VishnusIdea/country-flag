<h1> <a style="color:green">INDIA</a></h1>


<h2> <p style="color:rgb(244, 124, 20)">The Indian flag, also known as the Tricolour,
     is a symbol of the country's independence, unity, and diversity. It is a horizontal tricolour of saffron, white, 
     and green, with a navy blue Ashoka Chakra at its center.<br>
     The flag was first hoisted on August 15, 1947, when India gained its independence from British rule.<br>
    <br>The Indian flag is not just a symbol of the country's freedom and unity, but also its diversity.<br>
     India is a country with many languages, religions, and cultures. <br>
    The flag represents the idea that all of these diverse groups can come together to create a strong and united nation.

    <h2 style="color:green">COLOURS OF THE FLAG:</br>
    <p style="color:rgb(244, 124, 20)">In the national flag of India the top band is of Saffron colour, 
        indicating the strength and courage of the country. 
        The white middle band indicates peace and truth with Dharma Chakra.
         The last band is green in colour shows the fertility, growth and auspiciousness of the land.</p>
    
    
    <h2 style="color:green">THE CHAKRA:</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(244, 124, 20)">This Dharma Chakra depicted the "wheel of the law" 
        in the Sarnath Lion Capital made by  the 3rd-century BC Mauryan Emperor Ashoka. 
        The chakra intends to show that there is life in movement and death in stagnation.</p>

    <h2 style="color:green">FLAG CODE:
    <p style="color:rgb(244, 124, 20)">On 26th January 2002, the Indian flag code was modified and after several years of independence, 
         the citizens of India were finally allowed to hoist the Indian flag over their homes, offices and factories on any 
          day and not just National days as was the case earlier. Now Indians can proudly display the national flag any where and any time, as 
          long as the provisions of the Flag Code are strictly followed to avoid any disrespect to the tricolour. For the sake of convenience, 
          Flag Code of India, 2002, has been divided into three parts. Part I of the Code contains general description of the National Flag. Part
           II of the Code is devoted to the display of the National Flag by members of public, private organizations, educational institutions, etc
           . Part III of the Code relates to display of the National Flag by Central and State governments and their organisations and agencies.<p>
    
    There are some rules and regulations upon how to fly the flag, based on the 26 January 2002 legislation. </p>
