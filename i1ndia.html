<h2> <p style="color:rgb(244, 124, 20)">"A flag is a necessity for all nations. 
Millions have died for it. It is no doubt a kind of idolatry which would be a sin to destroy. For,a flag represents an
Ideal The unfurling of the Union Jack evokes in the English breast sentiments whose strength 
it is difficult to measure. The Stars and Stripes mean a world to the Americans.

"It will be necessary for us Indians Muslims, Christians Jews, Parsis, 
and all others to whom India is their home-to recognize a common flag to live and to die for."

    <h2 style="color:green">COLOURS OF THE FLAG:</br>
    <p style="color:rgb(244, 124, 20)">In the national flag of India the top band is of Saffron colour, 
        indicating the strength and courage of the country. 
        The white middle band indicates peace and truth with Dharma Chakra.
         The last band is green in colour shows the fertility, growth and auspiciousness of the land.</p>
    
    
    <h2 style="color:green">THE CHAKRA:
    <p style="color:rgb(244, 124, 20)">This Dharma Chakra depicted the "wheel of the law" 
        in the Sarnath Lion Capital made by  the 3rd-century BC Mauryan Emperor Ashoka. 
        The chakra intends to show that there is life in movement and death in stagnation.</p>

    <h2 style="color:green">FLAG CODE:
    <p style="color:rgb(244, 124, 20)">On 26th January 2002, the Indian flag code was modified and after several years of independence, 
         the citizens of India were finally allowed to hoist the Indian flag over their homes, offices and factories on any 
          day and not just National days as was the case earlier. Now Indians can proudly display the national flag any where and any time, as 
          long as the provisions of the Flag Code are strictly followed to avoid any disrespect to the tricolour. For the sake of convenience, 
          Flag Code of India, 2002, has been divided into three parts. Part I of the Code contains general description of the National Flag. Part
           II of the Code is devoted to the display of the National Flag by members of public, private organizations, educational institutions, etc
           . Part III of the Code relates to display of the National Flag by Central and State governments and their organisations and agencies.<p>
    
    There are some rules and regulations upon how to fly the flag, based on the 26 January 2002 legislation. </p>
